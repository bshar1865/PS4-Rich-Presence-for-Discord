# PS4-Rich-Presence-for-Discord
 Rich presence app for jailbroken playstation 4. Display what game you are playing on the PS4 via Discord.

## Warning
This script is very much still in beta testing, it has only been uploaded to github in this state to motivate me to continue working on it.  
I do not recommend using it in its current state, and due to how it works, a worst case possible scenario is it bricking your PS4.

## Vision
There will eventually be 2 versions of this script, one that utilises an external text document to translate game IDs into game names,  
and another that will do so using orbispatches.com
